## Introduction

Satoshi Spark is designed to facilitate crowdfunding campaigns via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. 

The project is built with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The project follows DDD principles to ensure a clear and maintainable codebase. 

The project is organized into several bounded contexts, each representing a distinct part of the domain:

- **Common**: Contains abstract and basic aggregate/ports/adapter definitions.
- **Auth**: Handles authentication and user management.
- **Accounting**: Manages account balances and transactions.
- **Bitcoin**: Manages Bitcoin Lightning Network-related operations, such as invoices.
- **Dashboard**: Provides a read-only context where users can view their activities.

Each bounded context encapsulates its own domain logic and interacts with other contexts only through messages.

### Aggregates, the building block of our write domain

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), aggregates define consistency boundaries in the write domain, ensuring that all changes within them maintain business rules and integrity. 
Each aggregate consists of closely related entities and has a root entity that controls modifications.

Repository operations only retrieve and persist aggregate roots.

```python
class Aggregate(ABC):
    def __init__(self, entity_id: str) -> None:
        self.__entity_id = entity_id

    @property
    def entity_id(self) -> str:
        return self.__entity_id

    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Aggregate):
            return False
        return self.entity_id == other.entity_id
```


## Unit of Work

The Unit of Work pattern is used to manage transactions and ensure data consistency. 
It tracks changes to aggregates and commits them as a single transaction.
This pattern represents an abstraction for any database (SQL or not) transaction, 
de-coupling the domain from particular database implementations.

### Example: Abstract Unit of Work

```python
# Abstract unit of work (UOW)
class UnitOfWork(ABC):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._messages: list[Message] = []  # The domain emits event to the UOW
        self._tracked_objects: list[tuple[object, Callable]] = []  # The UOW keeps track of aggregates to persist their changes 

    def emit(self, message: Message) -> None:
        self._messages.append(message)

    # Before commit, the UOW calls the persistence callback of each tracked object
    # and stores the messages in a transactional outbox (more on this later)
    async def commit(self) -> None:
        for obj, persistence_callback in self._tracked_objects:
            await persistence_callback()

        await outbox(self).store(self._messages)
        await self._commit()

    async def rollback(self) -> None:
        self._messages.clear()
        self._tracked_objects.clear()
        await self._rollback()

    @abstractmethod
    async def _commit(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def _rollback(self) -> None:
        pass
```

### Example: Postgres Unit Of Work implementation

```python
# Postgres specific implementation
class PostgresUnitOfWork(UnitOfWork):
    def __init__(self, conn: asyncpg.Connection, transaction: Transaction) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.__conn = conn
        self.__transaction = transaction

    @property
    def conn(self) -> asyncpg.Connection:
        return self.__conn

    async def _commit(self) -> None:
        await self.__transaction.commit()

    async def _rollback(self) -> None:
        await self.__transaction.rollback()
```

### Example: UOW in action

```python

```

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

CQRS is used to separate the read and write operations of the application. 
Commands are used to change the state of the system, while queries are used to retrieve data.

Commands are written as imperative verbs (do something...), while events are written as past verbs (something happened...).

### Example: Command and Event

```python
# Crowdfunding context example command:
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CreateCampaign(Command):
    entity_id: str
    account_id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    goal: int

    
# Accounting context example event:
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TransferSucceededEvent(Event):
    idempotency_key: str
    from_account_id: str
    to_account_id: str
    amount: int
    metadata: dict
```

### Write model

### Read model


## Transactional Outboxes

Transactional Outboxes ensure that messages are reliably sent even if the system crashes. They store messages in a database table and process them asynchronously.

### Example: Transactional Outbox

```python
class TransactionalOutbox(ABC):
    def __init__(self, uow: UnitOfWork) -> None:
        self.__uow = uow

    @abstractmethod
    async def store(self, messages: list[Message]) -> None:
        pass
```

## Distributed Systems

Satoshi Spark is designed to be a distributed system, with components that can be scaled independently. The use of DDD, CQRS, Units of Work, and Transactional Outboxes helps to manage the complexity of distributed systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with Satoshi Spark, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satoshi-spark.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the database and run the migrations:
    ```sh
    # Add your database setup and migration commands here
    ```

4. Start the application:
    ```sh
    # Add your application start command here
    ```
